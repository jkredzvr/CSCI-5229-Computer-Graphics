## HW 1-Lorenz Attractor notes
Justin Chin 
CSCI 5229 Computer Graphics
### Assignment Requirements
At a minimum: ( get a simple scene rendered and basic user interaction)
- provide a line trace of the sequence of attractor
- allow the trace to be viewed from different positions 
- allow one or more of the parameters in the Lorenz equations to be modified interactively


### Application Instructions
#### How to change the view
#### How to change parameters

### Estimated time of finishing assignment
- _XXXX_ hrs

### Submission
1. One ZIP or TAR archive containing all files you are submitting;
2. Source code and Makefile. I'm going to recompile and run this on a Linux/Ubuntu box so use #ifdef in your code if you use things that are not portable. (If you don't have access to a Linux box and the GLX code doesn't work it won't count against you. Note that any changes you made to the example programs probably will cause problems for me.)
3. Provide a README with brief instructions on how to use the program.
4. Optional: If you discovered anything interesting about the Lorenz Attractor you can attach a brief writeup. If plain text won't do, a PDF file would be best;
5. Time it took you to complete the assignment.


#### Submission checklist:
1. Make sure your program compiles with no warnings (gcc -Wall is your friend);
2. Make sure that the program behaves correctly when the window is resized;
3. The program should start with something interesting to see - don't make me work to see something worth while;
4. Make sure the README tells me what buttons to press to make something happen
