# Justin Chin HW 1-Lorenz Attractor
CSCI 5229 Computer Graphics

### Assignment Requirements
At a minimum: ( get a simple scene rendered and basic user interaction)

- provide a line trace of the sequence of attractor
- allow the trace to be viewed from different positions 
- allow one or more of the parameters in the Lorenz equations to be modified interactively

### Application Instructions
####How to change the view

* Press 1 key to view  (1) Lorenz Attractor 
* Press 2 key to view(2) Lorenz Attractors w/ modifable 2nd Lorenz initial conditions
* Pressing the arrows changes the pitch and yaw  view angle
* Press 0 to reset view angle

#### Exiting the Application
* Press ESC to exit the application

#### How to change Lorenz Attractor Parameters
In view 1 and 2, press the following keys to 

* o/p - Decrease/Increase s Lorenz Attractor parameter
* k/l - Decrease/Increase b Lorenz Attractor parameter
* n/m - Decrease/Increase r Lorenz Attractor parameter


### How to change Lorenz Attractor initial conditions (x,y,z)
In view 2 (viewing two Lorenz Attractors) press the following keys to  

* q/w - Decrease/Increase x intial coordinate for 2nd Lorenz Attractor 
* a/s - Decrease/Increase y intial coordinate for 2nd Lorenz Attractor
* z/x - Decrease/Increase z intial coordinate for 2nd Lorenz Attractor

### Estimated time of finishing assignment
