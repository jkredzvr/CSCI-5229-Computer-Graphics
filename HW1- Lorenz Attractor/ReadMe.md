## HW 1-Lorenz Attractor notes
Justin Chin 
CSCI 5229 Computer Graphics

### Assignment Requirements
At a minimum: ( get a simple scene rendered and basic user interaction)
- provide a line trace of the sequence of attractor
- allow the trace to be viewed from different positions 
- allow one or more of the parameters in the Lorenz equations to be modified interactively

### Application Instructions
#### How to change the view
Press the 1 and 2 keys to switch between viewing (1) Lorenz Attractor or (2) Lorenz Attractors w/ modifable 2nd Lorenz initial conditions

Pressing the arrows changes the pitch and yaw  view angle
Press 0 to reset view angle

#### Exiting the Application
Press ESC to exit the application

### How to change Lorenz Attractor initial conditions (x,y,z)
For view 1 and two, press the following keys to 
o/p - Decrease/Increase s intial coordinate for 2nd Lorenz Attractor
k/l - Decrease/Increase b intial coordinate for 2nd Lorenz Attractor
n/m - Decrease/Increase r intial coordinate for 2nd Lorenz Attractor

#### How to change Lorenz Attractor Parameters
In view 2 (viewing two Lorenz Attractors) press the following keys to  
q/w - Decrease/Increase x intial coordinate for 2nd Lorenz Attractor 
a/s - Decrease/Increase y intial coordinate for 2nd Lorenz Attractor 
z/x - Decrease/Increase z intial coordinate for 2nd Lorenz Attractor

### Estimated time of finishing assignment
- 4 hrs programming
